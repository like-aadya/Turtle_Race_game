# Turtle Race Game

A simple turtle race game made with Python’s turtle module. The turtles race across the screen at random speeds — the winner is completely random each time!

How It Works
Run the game.

A group of turtles races from left to right.

The race is random — no player input needed.

One turtle wins, and that's it. Just for fun!
